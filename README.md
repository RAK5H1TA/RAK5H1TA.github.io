## About <a name="about"></a>
This is the first iteration of my portfolio website, however, it is more than just a fun side project.
I created this website to not only showcase my skills & projects but also to finish Harvard's [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/).
I wanted to create a project that would not only fulfill the course's requirements but would also be helpful to me in the long run.

If you like what you see, please consider giving this repository a __star__<br>

## FAQ <a name="faq"></a>
### Why have you not used frameworks like Jekyll, Bootstrap, React or others?
* Simply because I wanted to learn more about vanilla CSS, HTML & JS. I intentionally avoided using any or all frameworks to sharpen my skills in these technologies.

## Credits <a name="creds"></a>
Following list includes the names of all the people & resources which helped in the creation<br>
Thanks to: 

- [@bchiang7](https://github.com/bchiang7) creator of [brittanychiang.com](https://brittanychiang.com/). You may or may not have noticed the resemblance between her & my website, its because her website inspired me to create my own around the same minimalistic style. I simply didn't want to copy & paste her website, but rather take inspiration from her amazing designer skills & color combos. A special thanks to her!
